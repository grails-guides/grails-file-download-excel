Create a controller:

[source, groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/example/grails/ExcelController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/example/grails/ExcelController.groovy[]
----

<1> Implement `grails.core.support.GrailsConfigurationAware` to
configure mime types and encoding configuration.
<2> A controller method can access the http://docs.grails.org/3.3.8/ref/Servlet%20API/response.html[response] object which is an instace of Servlet APIâ€™s https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html[HttpServletResponse] class
<3> Set `Content-Disposition` to indicate the file should be downloaded.
<4> Set the download `Content-Type`.
<5> Write excel file to output stream, flush and close it.


By default, a Grails application created from scratch contains a link to every controller registered in the application. We will test that clicking that links downloads an Excel file.
